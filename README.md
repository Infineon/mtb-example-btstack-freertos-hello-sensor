## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).
</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Bluetooth&reg; LE hello sensor](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-hello-sensor)" application with the desired name "mtb-example-btstack-freertos-hello-sensor" configured for the *CYW920829M2EVB-01* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CYW920829M2EVB-01 --app-id mtb-example-btstack-freertos-hello-sensor --user-app-name mtb-example-btstack-freertos-hello-sensor --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).
</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application to access the serial port using the following settings.

   Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or auto setting

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CYW920829M2EVB-01 TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal, and wait for the device to connect with peer client (eg. CySmart App). Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window:

   **Figure 1. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

   ![](images/teraterm.png)

5. To test using the CySmart mobile app, do the following (see equivalent CySmart app screenshots in Figure 2 and Figure 3):

   1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

   2. Launch the CySmart app.

   3. Swipe down on the CySmart app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device (“Hello") appears in the CySmart app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection. 

   4. Select the 'GATT DB' from the carousel view.

   5. On the client side register for notifications or indications. This will, in turn, initiate the pairing process.

   6. In the Services page, select "Unknown Service" and choose the first characteristic to enable Notifications/indications. Press the user button 1 in the kit and observe that notification/indication being received in the mobile app.

      **Figure 2. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**
         ![](./images/teraterm_log.png)

   7. You can choose the second characteristic and write some value into it and observe that the user LED in the board will blink those many number of times as written in the Hello Sensor characteristic.

## Steps to enable BTSpy Logs

- In makefile, make ENABLE_SPY_TRACES=1
- Build and program the board
- Open ClientControl
- Set the baud rate to 3000000
- Deselect the flow control checkbox
- Select the port and click on open port
- Launch BTSpy
- Press and release the reset button on the board to get the BTSpy logs


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

**Note:** Debugging is of limited value when there is an active Bluetooth&reg; LE connection because as soon as the Bluetooth&reg; LE device stops responding, the connection will get dropped.


## Design and implementation

The code example configures the device as a Bluetooth&reg; LE GAP peripheral and GATT server. The example implements a custom GATT profile that includes three services - Hello Sensor custom service, Device Information service, and battery level service. The Hello Sensor service includes two custom characteristics - Notify and Blink. The notify characteristic is used to send a notification or indication to the peer client device upon button press events. The Blink characteristic is used by the peer client to write the number of times the on-board user LED should blink. 

The application uses a UART resource from the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to print debug messages on a UART terminal emulator. The UART resource initialization and retargetting of standard I/O to the UART port are done using the retarget-io library.

Upon reset, the application starts automatically and initializes the BT stack and other device peripherals. The device starts to advertise its presence to the peer central devices. Once a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection is established, the peer client device can register for notifications/indications to be received by using the CCCD handle of the Notify characteristic. Since the CCCD handle of the Notify characteristic requires write authentication, an attempt to enable notification/indication will trigger the pairing process at the central side. Once the pairing process completes, the peer device's link keys and addresses are stored in the device's flash memory and hence bonded. The user button on the board is configured to trigger an interrupt on falling edge. When the on-board user button is pressed, we send a notification to the peer client device. The peer client can also write the number of times the user LED in the board blinks using the Blink characteristic.

## Resources and settings

This section explains the ModusToolbox&trade; software resources and their configurations as used in this code example. Note that all the configurations explained in this section have already been implemented in the code example.

- **Device configurator:** ModusToolbox&trade; software stores the configuration settings of the application in the *design.modus* file. This file is used by the device configurator, which generates the configuration firmware. This firmware is stored in the application’s *GeneratedSource* folder.

   By default, all applications in a workspace share the same *design.modus* file - i.e., they share the same pin configuration. Each BSP has a default *design.modus* file in the *mtb_shared\TARGET_\<bsp name\>\<version\>\COMPONENT_BSP_DESIGN_MODUS* directory. It is not recommended to modify the configuration of a standard BSP directly.

   To modify the configuration for a single application or to create a custom BSP refer to the [ModusToolbox&trade; User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/file/504361/download). In this example we are using the default configuration. See the [Device configurator guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxDeviceConfig).

- **Bluetooth&reg; configurator:** The Bluetooth&reg; peripheral has an additional configurator called the “Bluetooth&reg; configurator” that is used to generate the Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT database and various Bluetooth&reg; settings for the application. These settings are stored in the file named *design.cybt*.

   Note that unlike the device configurator, the Bluetooth&reg; configurator settings and files are local to each respective application. The services and characteristics added are explained in the [Design and implementation](#design-and-implementation) section. See the [Bluetooth&reg; Configurator Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxBLEConfig).

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port|
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED1         | This LED will blink the number of times as written by the peer client device |
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_BTN         | Used to send notifications to the peer client on button press events |
